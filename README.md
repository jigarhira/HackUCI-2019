DriveAlert is a way to extend smart-car safety to everyone. As you drive, it takes note of how frequently you close your eyes and alerts you when you've surpassed the threshold, which is a likely indicator you've begun to fall asleep. DriveAlert will then play music to wake you back up and also send a text message to your designated emergency contacts notifying them that you've fallen asleep at the wheel and telling them to come pick you up.
